Atomicles
---------

Atomicles was written with reliability, correctnessm, and portability in mind.
Hence it does not use some of the more creamy system calls available on Linux,
but sticks to the old XSI extensions (from the Single UNIX Specifications) from
the 1970s (AT&T).

This is not really a problem, as none of the system calls in the tools shipped
in this package ever need to run at a high rate.  Reliability is the goal here.

It will compile on Linux, Apple Mac OS X, and IBM AIX.
